# Crawl to the Dungeon 

Crawl into the Dungeon is an interactive dungeon defined with a linked data environment and hosted by an embedded linked data platform (Apache Jena Fuseki)
It uses the LinkedDataFuSpider artifact to make CRUD requests and fetch resources over a custom dungeon environment with rooms, doors and items.

To have a good understanding on what the Crawl into the Dungeon project is about, read the PDF presentation file located in the root project.

## Getting started

Prerequesite : 
- JVM 8 or more.
- Gradle
				
### How to run the project

Run `gradle runDungeon` in the root project. You should see the JaCaMo GUI interface appears.
Alternatively, you can use the uberjar with all dependencies with `java -jar build/libs/RunnerCITDProject-0.1.jar` (currently not working).

## How to navigate into the dungeon

Running the runDungeon task will launch a JaCaMo application with an "adventurer" agent. JaCaMo will open the MAS console interface where you can see the dashboard about the running jacamo agents. If you don't know much about JaCaMo, you can refer to the documentation [here](http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/).
In the UI interface, you can check the current beliefs and intentions an agent has by clicking on `debug` and on the name of the agent. You may see beliefs representing triples like `rdf(_, _, _)` or even derived properties generated by the LinkedDataFuSpider extension such as `room(room1)`.
The agent is autonomous and will look at the solution by executing an action every 2s through ordered preferences.

You can get access to the first room through [http://localhost:3030/atacDungeon/room1/](http://localhost:3030/atacDungeon/room1/) as the entrypoint of our Knowledge Graph.

When multiple actions are of same preference (e.g. moving to door A or door B), the decision is taken randomly. Change the seed to take a different order of actions in the dungeon.jcm file.

## Acknowledgment
Thanks to Victor Charpenay for developing along myself the LinkedDataFuSpider artifact.
